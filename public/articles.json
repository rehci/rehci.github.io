In Human-Computer Interaction, representation is central: it shapes what users notice, what they can do, and what they believe is possible.\n\n## What is Data Representation?\n\nAt a basic level, data representation involves:\n\n- **Internal representations**: How data is stored inside a system (models, schemas, graphs, logs).  \n- **External repre"
