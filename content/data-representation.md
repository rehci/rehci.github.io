# Data Representation in HCI

Data representation is about how information is encoded, structured, and presented so people can understand it and act on it. In Human-Computer Interaction, representation is central: it shapes what users notice, what they can do, and what they believe is possible.

## What is Data Representation?

At a basic level, data representation involves:

- **Internal representations**: How data is stored inside a system (models, schemas, graphs, logs).  
- **External representations**: How data appears to users (charts, tables, maps, timelines, diagrams).  
- **Mappings**: How internal structures are translated into external views and back again.  

Good representations make complex information feel approachable; poor ones obscure important patterns or mislead users.

## Roles of Representation in Interaction

Data representation affects interaction in several ways:

1. **Perception**: What users see first (color, position, shape) steers their attention.  
2. **Interpretation**: Encodings influence how trends, outliers, and relationships are perceived.  
3. **Action**: Available controls and widgets determine how users can transform or filter data.  
4. **Memory**: External representations reduce cognitive load by offloading details to the display.

HCI designers must consider both visual design and cognitive processes when choosing representations.

## Types of External Representations

Common forms include:

- **Charts and plots**: Line charts for trends, bar charts for comparisons, scatter plots for relationships.  
- **Tables and lists**: Structured views for precise values and sorting.  
- **Maps and spatial layouts**: Geographic or conceptual spatialization of information.  
- **Networks and graphs**: Nodes and edges representing relationships.  
- **Timelines**: Temporal sequences and durations.

Each form has strengths and weaknesses depending on the task and data.

## Design Considerations

When designing data representations in HCI, key considerations include:

- **Task fit**: Does the representation support the questions users want to answer?  
- **Scale**: How does the design behave with very small or very large datasets?  
- **Uncertainty**: Are error, missing data, or estimates communicated clearly?  
- **Accessibility**: Can people with diverse abilities perceive and operate the representation?  
- **Interaction**: Can users zoom, filter, highlight, annotate, or rearrange information?

Interactive representations often reveal more insight than static ones, because users can manipulate the view to match their thinking.

## Internal Representations and HCI

Even though internal representations are not directly visible, they impact:

- **Latency**: How quickly interfaces respond to queries or transformations.  
- **Expressiveness**: What kinds of queries and analyses are possible.  
- **Consistency**: Whether different views of the same data stay in sync.  

Designers and engineers must coordinate models and interfaces so that user-visible representations remain accurate and responsive.

## Pitfalls and Biases

Common issues in data representation include:

- **Cherry-picking scales** that exaggerate or minimize differences.  
- **Over-encoding** too many variables at once, creating visual noise.  
- **Ambiguous encodings** where color, shape, or size can be interpreted multiple ways.  
- **Hidden biases** in data collection and labeling that carry through to visualizations.

Responsible HCI practice involves making assumptions visible and giving users tools to question or reframe the data.

## Summary

Data representation in HCI is about more than pretty charts. It involves thoughtful choices about how information is modeled, encoded, and interacted with, so that people can see patterns, make decisions, and maintain appropriate trust in digital systems.
